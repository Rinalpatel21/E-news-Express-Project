## E-news Express Project
E-news Express is a data analysis project that investigates the effectiveness of a **new landing page design** for an online news portal. Using a simulated dataset of user interactions, this project applies **exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and visualization** to understand whether the updated landing page leads to better user engagement and conversions compared to the original.

This project used statistical analysis, a/b testing, and visualization to decide whether the new landing page of an online news portal (E-news Express) is effective enough to gather new subscribers or not. The simulated dataset has certain important metrics such as converted status and time spent on the page that will help to conclude the effectiveness of the new landing page. Apart from that, the dependence of conversion on the preferred language will also be analyzed in this project.

## Problem Statement

E-news Express wants to grow its subscriber base by optimizing the user experience on its landing page. Specifically, this project asks key questions such as:

- **Does the new landing page increase the conversion rate?**
- **Do users spend more time on the new landing page compared to the old one?**
- **Does the user’s preferred language impact conversion or time spent on the page?**

By answering these questions, the project helps determine whether the new design is effective and influences business decisions.

## Project Goals

1. **Evaluate Landing Page Performance**  
   Compare the new and old landing pages to determine which has a higher conversion rate and engagement time.

2. **Perform Hypothesis Testing**  
   Use statistical methods to validate whether observed differences are significant.

3. **Analyze Language Impact**  
   Understand if preferred language influences conversion behavior or engagement with the page.

4. **Visualize Findings**  
   Present results in clear, interpretable plots and charts.

## Tools & Techniques Used

| Category | Tools / Techniques |
|----------|-------------------|
| Programming | Python |
| Data Handling | Pandas, NumPy |
| Visualization | Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| Statistical Testing | Hypothesis Testing, p-values |
| Environment | Jupyter Notebook |
| Key Skills | Data Wrangling, EDA, Statistical Inference, Visualization |

These tools enable robust data exploration and help draw meaningful insights from the simulated dataset.

## Insights & Key Findings

- **Landing Page Comparison:** The analysis examines differences in conversion rates and engagement between the two page designs.  
- **Time on Page Metrics:** Average and distribution of time spent on each landing page are visualized and compared.  
- **Language Influence:** The relationship between preferred language and conversion is investigated to uncover potential behavioral patterns.  

These insights help assess whether the new design is statistically better than the old one and identify segments that may respond differently.
